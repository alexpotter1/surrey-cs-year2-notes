# Advanced Algorithms
## Introduction
Recap: An algorithm:
* Is an abstract procedure on how to calculate something
* Exists independently of implementation (operating system, programming language)
* Algorithms have associated complexities, notably time and space

Time complexity is a property of the algorithm itself and not the implementation.

There is no general way to find an algorithm for a given problem. Solving a problem requires careful consideration, and is usually tackled in three steps:
1. Is there even an algorithm at all that could solve this problem? Some problems may only be solved by a **brute-force** approach
2. Is the algorithm *right*? Does it solve the problem in a finite time, or does it take an infinite amount of time to solve?
3. Can the algorithm be improved and its overall computational complexity be reduced? Or is there a more efficient algorithm?
