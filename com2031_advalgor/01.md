# Advanced Algorithms
## Introduction
Recap: An algorithm:
* Is an abstract procedure on how to calculate something
* Exists independently of implementation (operating system, programming language)
* Algorithms have associated complexities, notably time and space

Time complexity is a property of the algorithm itself and not the implementation.

There is no general way to find an algorithm for a given problem. Solving a problem requires careful consideration, and is usually tackled in three steps:
1. Is there even an algorithm at all that could solve this problem? Some problems may only be solved by a **brute-force** approach
2. Is the algorithm *right*? Does it solve the problem in a finite time, or does it take an infinite amount of time to solve?
3. Can the algorithm be improved and its overall computational complexity be reduced? Or is there a more efficient algorithm?

## Examples of problems

**_Sequence Alignment Problem_**
* Spellcheck
* Similarity metric - distance between strings (alphabetically)
* A penalty cost for mismatched letters and gaps in strings: lowest cost = better spelled word for example

**_Closest Pair of Points_**
* Goal: Find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them
* Metric for shortest distance would be **Euclidean distance**

**_Shortest Path (Dijkstra)_**
* Already covered

**_Graph k-Colouring problem_**
* Connected graph of vertices
* Any two adjacent vertices must have a differing colour
* Can all vertices satisfy this problem?

**_Knapsack problem_**
* Already covered

**_GCD problem_**
* Given two integers `a` and `b`, find the **greatest common divisor** between them, `d`.
* Example: `gcd(12,18)` is equal to 6
* Example 2: `gcd(27,13)` is equal to 1, since 27 and 13 are *co-prime*.
