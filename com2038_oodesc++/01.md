# Object Oriented Design and C++
## Introduction

### History of C++
C++ is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983. It was designed with a bias towards lower-level system programming; this includes embedded and resource-constrained systems.

One can program in many different styles: *object-oriented*, *procedural*, *imperative* and *generic*. It allows the developer to utilise many key features of object-oriented design, such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. It also allows for more high-level, dynamic memory allocation and control compared to C.

The language is similar to C in design, and in fact there is a degree of interoperability between both languages as C++ started life as a fork from an early, pre-standardised C language. Some C-based functions, like `printf()`, can be used with little difficulty. However, **C++ is not a strict superset of C**. Most non-trivial C programs **will not** compile with a C++ compiler without some modification.

For example, here is code that is acceptable and valid when compiled to C, but will not compile with C++, and will throw errors:
```cpp
void* ptr;
// C++ checks type-safety much more rigorously, hence this implicit cast between pointer types is not acceptable here.
int* i = ptr;
```

Some code will also exhibit differing behaviour in C and C++, even if both segments are the same and compile successfully. For this reason, interoperability and migration between C and C++ must be handled with caution.

#### C++ Compilation
There are two main compilers for C++ - GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and LLVM/Clang. `g++`, the compiler executable, will usually default to one of these depending on OS and environment - for example, on Linux this is GCC, on macOS this is Clang.

* There usually is a difference in executable bytecode produced by GCC and Clang.
* Clang can be faster to compile, and can **occasionally** produce faster code. Other times, optimisations performed by GCC can often make code operate better on **some hardware**.
* Clang is newer than GCC, and acts as a front end to LLVM - a very powerful and versatile intermediate code generator and low-level virtual machine. However, since the compiler system is not as mature as GCC, it can sometimes produce slightly less robust code.
* Clang is arguably much better than GCC for debugging and diagnostics, although this may change.

### General C++ design and operation

* C++ builds upon C, adding object-oriented functionality to programs.

* Program execution starts with `main`, with a return type of `int`.

* Sometimes, external header files may need to be included in the program if functions are used which are outside of the main program's scope. `#include` is used to include these files.

* C++ includes support for the `string` data type. This can be used by the preprocessor directive `#include <string>`. For backward-compatibility reasons, C-style `char*` can also be used as strings. The native type is recommended though for C++.

* Constants can be defined by `const`, like C

* `cin` and `cout` make accessing standard I/O streams easy

An example of a C++ program is this:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {
  cout << "Hello World" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

*NB: The main function can have zero arguments, but this example includes arguments to allow parsing of additional command line options to the program.*

### How to compile?
* Command line, with g++ (GCC/Clang)
* With a **Makefile**
* IDE with built-in compilation tools (e.g. Xcode, MS Visual Studio etc)

With C++, a source file is compiled to an object file, which is then linked with any declared libraries to form an executable.

To compile/link a C++ file, we can invoke `g++` on the command line with:
- `g++ -c hello.cpp` -> compiles to `hello.o`
- `g++ hello.o -o hello` -> compile object file to `hello` executable
- `g++ -o hello hello1.cpp hello2.cpp` -> generate executable with multiple source files

Options can be passed to the C++ compiler, such as:
* `-Wall` : turn on all warnings
* `-g` : debugging flag
* `-I` : Instruct GCC to look in a specific folder for header files
* `-L` : Instruct GCC to look in a specific folder for library files

GCC can also handle additional code optimisation techniques which can greatly impact performance on certain devices. Common options include:
* `-On` : Level n optimisation (`-O1` being least optimised, `-O3` being most optimised)
* `-Ofast` : Special optimisation level, enables all `-O3` optimisations and disables optimisations that are not valid for all standard-compliant programs. Can be slightly less stable than `-O3`.
* `-Os` : Special optimisation level, enables all `-O2` optimisations that do not increase code size, generates size-optimal executables
* `-ffast-math` : Allows for transformations to be used to result in correct code, but may not conform to IEEE standards. Use with care.
* `-fgcse` : Optimises loop performance, moving load/store calls outside of the loop body to reduce execution step count.

### What's a Makefile?
A Makefile is a file describing how to create an executable from multiple source files. A Makefile can be used in the compilation/linking stage by invoking `make` followed by aliases defined in the makefile.

A Makefile usually includes:
* A target (file)
* Dependencies
* Additional options passed to the compiler

It can be helpful to add a `clean` directive to the Makefile:
```
clean:
  \rm *.o *~ <program alias/name>
```

Macros can also be included in a Makefile, to simplify editing source file locations and compiler options.

## Key Concepts of Object-Oriented Design
Object Oriented Design makes use of four main principles:
* Abstraction
  * The idea of generalising a concept to reduce its complexity and improve efficiency
  * For example, `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` can be abstracted as types of `List`
* Encapsulation
  * Enforcing data access through approved accessor/mutator methods
  * Assures predictable ways of getting data
  * Cannot access the data of an object directly
* Inheritance
  * A class can inherit methods and data from a superclass
  * Encourages code reuse without code duplication
  * For example, `LinkedList` and `ArrayList` utilise methods defined in `List`, but they also extend `List` to add custom functionality
* Polymorphism
  * Provision of a single interface to multiple types
  * Describe ways of doing some generic function, and then this can be applied to specific objects.
  * Generics and polymorphic typecasting (subtyping)

## C++ language features
#### Inline functions
Like C, C++ has support for *inline functions*. These are normal C/C++ functions that are prefixed with the `inline` keyword. It acts as a compiler directive that suggests that the compiler substitute the code defined in the `inline` function into the address of the function call itself. This saves a function call, and can result in better performance.

* Inline functions are suited to very short (either one or two) line functions, such as accessors of a class' private data, since the computation cost of the function call overhead would influence the function's overall performance significantly.

However, the `inline` function **does not force the compiler to inline**. It merely acts as a suggestion. Some compilers do have a compilation flag to force inline all functions, even ones that aren't explicitly defined as `inline`. But, performing inline expansion optimisation on functions where it isn't necessarily needed may not be possible, or it may hinder performance.

* For example, virtual inline functions cannot be inlined if they are called virtually. A direct call to a virtual inline function does allow the function to be inlined, though.
