# Object Oriented Design and C++
## Introduction

* C++ builds upon C, adding object-oriented functionality to programs.

* Program execution starts with `main`, with a return type of `int`.

* Sometimes, external header files may need to be included in the program if functions are used which are outside of the main program's scope. `#include` is used to include these files.

An example of a C++ program is this:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {
  cout << "Hello World" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

*NB: The main function can have zero arguments, but this example includes arguments to allow parsing of additional command line options to the program.*

### How to compile?
* Command line, with g++ (GCC/Clang)
* With a **Makefile**
* IDE with built-in compilation tools (e.g. Xcode, MS Visual Studio etc)

With C++, a source file is compiled to an object file, which is then linked with any declared libraries to form an executable.

To compile/link a C++ file, we can invoke `g++` on the command line with:
- `g++ -c hello.cpp` -> compiles to `hello.o`
- `g++ hello.o -o hello` -> compile object file to `hello` executable
- `g++ -o hello hello1.cpp hello2.cpp` -> generate executable with multiple source files

Options can be passed to the C++ compiler, such as:
* `-Wall` : turn on all warnings
* `-g` : debugging flag
* `-I` : Instruct GCC to look in a specific folder for header files
* `-L` : Instruct GCC to look in a specific folder for library files

GCC can also handle additional code optimisation techniques which can greatly impact performance on certain devices. Common options include:
* `-On` : Level n optimisation (`-O1` being least optimised, `-O3` being most optimised)
* `-Ofast` : Special optimisation level, enables all `-O3` optimisations and disables optimisations that are not valid for all standard-compliant programs. Can be slightly less stable than `-O3`.
* `-Os` : Special optimisation level, enables all `-O2` optimisations that do not increase code size, generates size-optimal executables
* `-ffast-math` : Allows for transformations to be used to result in correct code, but may not conform to IEEE standards. Use with care.
* `-fgcse` : Optimises loop performance, moving load/store calls outside of the loop body to reduce execution step count.

### What's a Makefile?
A Makefile is a file describing how to create an executable from multiple source files. A Makefile can be used in the compilation/linking stage by invoking `make` followed by aliases defined in the makefile.

A Makefile usually includes:
* A target (file)
* Dependencies
* Additional options passed to the compiler

It can be helpful to add a `clean` directive to the Makefile:
```
clean:
  \rm *.o *~ <program alias/name>
```

Macros can also be included in a Makefile, to simplify editing source file locations and compiler options.
