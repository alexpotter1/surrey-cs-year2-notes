# Computer Networking (COM2022)

*How does the Internet work?*

* Protocol: A way of communicating between multiple devices in a standardised manner
* Several layers of protocols and communication (OSI Model)
  * High level protocols (application layer) - HTTP, SMTP
  * Middle level protocols (network layer) - TCP/IP (TCP/UDP), ARP, DHCP
  * Low level protocols (transmission layer) - Ethernet, WiFi, ADSL, 3G/4G

### What does a network need to do?

* Ensure hosts **do not transmit at the same time**
* Establish **rules** to ensure that each host gets **fair access to the network**
* Have **protocols** to **route data efficiently** around the network, **minimising transmission time and wait periods**
* An **address** scheme to **uniquely identify** hosts

### Key aspects of networking

* **Data communication**: signals over wires
* **Networks**: packets over bits
* **Internet**: datagrams over packets
* **Network programming**: application data over the Internet
* **Cross functional concepts and technologies**: network configuration, control and management

#### Two key properties that protocols specify: Syntax and Semantics

* Syntax: format of messages, representation of data, encoding of signals
* Semantics: meaning of messages, procedures for exchanging messages, error handling

Protocols interact with each other in defined layers, because communication is complicated:

* ISO defines a **7-layer** model
* Internet protocols use a **5-layer** reference model

## Description of layers

### Physical Layer

* Underlying transmission
* Multiplexing/demultiplexing
* Electrical properties, like radio frequencies and voltages
* Associated hardware

### Network Interface Layer

* Communication between a computer and its network hardware
* Datalink/MAC layer
* Hardware (MAC) addressing
* Packet formats
* Error detection

### Internet Layer

* Communication between a pair of computers over the Internet
* Internet packet format
* Internet addressing model (IPv4/IPv6) and address assignment
* Forwarding/masquerade of packets
* Dividing an Internet packet into smaller packets for transmission
* More error detection

### Transport layer

* Communication between a pair of applications
* Demultiplexing among multiple destinations on one computer
* Reliable delivery/retransmission
* Controls data rate and avoids congestion

### Application Layer

* Format and representation of data and messages
* Procedures applications follow to transfer data/handle errors
* Meaning (semantics) of messages exchanged
* Internet infrastructure such as routing/DNS

**Note**: A router only needs layer 2 *(network interface)* and layer 3 *(Internet)* software to effectively route packets across the network.
