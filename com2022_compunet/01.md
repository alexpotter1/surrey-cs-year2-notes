*How does the Internet work?*

* Protocol: A way of communicating between multiple devices in a standardised manner
* Several layers of protocols and communication (OSI Model)
  * High level protocols (application layer) - HTTP, SMTP
  * Middle level protocols (network layer) - TCP/IP (TCP/UDP), ARP, DHCP
  * Low level protocols (transmission layer) - Ethernet, WiFi, ADSL, 3G/4G

### What does a network need to do?

* Ensure hosts **do not transmit at the same time**
* Establish **rules** to ensure that each host gets **fair access to the network**
* Have **protocols** to **route data efficiently** around the network, **minimising transmission time and wait periods**
* An **address** scheme to **uniquely identify** hosts

### Key aspects of networking

* **Data communication**: signals over wires
* **Networks**: packets over bits
* **Internet**: datagrams over packets
* **Network programming**: application data over the Internet
* **Cross functional concepts and technologies**: network configuration, control and management

#### Two key properties that protocols specify: Syntax and Semantics

* Syntax: format of messages, representation of data, encoding of signals
* Semantics: meaning of messages, procedures for exchanging messages, error handling

Protocols interact with each other in defined layers, because communication is complicated:

* ISO defines a **7-layer** model
* Internet protocols use a **5-layer** reference model

### Internet Reference Model

## Description of layers

### Physical Layer

* Underlying transmission
* Multiplexing/demultiplexing
* Electrical properties, like radio frequencies and voltages
* Associated hardware

### Network Interface Layer

* Communication between a computer and its network hardware
* Datalink/MAC layer
* Hardware (MAC) addressing
* Packet formats
* Error detection

### Internet Layer

* Communication between a pair of computers over the Internet
* Internet packet format
* Internet addressing model (IPv4/IPv6) and address assignment
* Forwarding/masquerade of packets
* Dividing an Internet packet into smaller packets for transmission
* More error detection

### Transport layer

* Communication between a pair of applications
* Demultiplexing among multiple destinations on one computer
* Reliable delivery/retransmission
* Controls data rate and avoids congestion

### Application Layer

* Format and representation of data and messages
* Procedures applications follow to transfer data/handle errors
* Meaning (semantics) of messages exchanged
* Internet infrastructure such as routing/DNS

**Note**: A router only needs layer 2 *(network interface)* and layer 3 *(Internet)* software to effectively route packets across the network.



### Internet Services and Communication

* The Internet does not provide services itself. It only provides communication, and applications provide all of the services.
* Every Internet communication involves communication amongst application programs
* Internet offers two communication paradigms:
  * Stream paradigm: **TCP**, **transfers a sequence of bytes**
  * Message paradigm: **UDP**, **connectionless state**
* When using TCP:
  * Make sure that the receiver knows where a message ends
  * Read from a socket until the entire message has been acquired
* TCP includes a *push* operation that applications can use to force transmission/delivery
  * Unix convention: automatically *push* for each individual *write* call

#### Client-Server model

* One application acts as **server**, other acts as **client**

  * Server starts execution first, awaits contact
  * Client starts after server, initiates contact (`HelloServer` handshake)

* Once communication is established, data can flow **bi-directionally**

* Server handles many requests at once, is inherently **parallel**

* **The TLS handshake**, captured with `curl`:

  ```

  * HTTP request types: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH/PUT`, `DELETE`

* Email

  * SMTP

    * Uses the stream paradigm

    * Only transfers textual messages

    * Terminates messages with `<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>`

    * Sends one copy only of a message to a computer

      ​

  * POP3

  * IMAP

  * Non-textual email: **S/MIME**

* FTP

  * Control channel, data channel
  * Server forms data connection for each file transferred
  * Server closes data connection after each transfer is complete

* Remote login: SSH/Telnet

* DNS

  * Hierarchical structure
  * Resolves domain names to IP addresses
  * Resolutions are cached positively/negatively

### Topology of the Internet

* How to link computers (nodes) if there are several of them?
  * Which is the most efficient routing?
  * What happens if computers drop out/disconnect from the network? Are others still reachable?
  * What if physical links fail/corrode/are cut?
* A very naïve solution: physical connections between **all** nodes
  * Number of physical connections grow quadratically as more nodes are connected to the network
  * Obviously, not optimal for networks at scale
* A better solution: Each node is connected to a **shared bus**
  * Shared, high-bandwidth main link
  * Addresses could be a problem
  * Multiple nodes transmitting *simultaneously* could be an issue (multiplexing/bandwidth availability/QoS prioritisation)
* An alternative solution: Nodes are connected by a **ring system**
  * Nodes can 'help' each other
  * Distant nodes can be connected indirectly by intermediary nodes
* Other models/topologies exist
  * **Hub/Spoke networks**
  * **Star networks**
  * **Mesh networks**
  * **Tree networks**

#### Packets

* Data is divided into small units, called **packets**
* Packets are forwarded through the network similar to how a courier/Post Office system handles letters and parcels
  * Sender breaks the data into pieces, encapsulates them into packets, defines the origin/destination addresses, and sends them through an available network interface
  * Sender/receiver isn't actually aware of the path of the packets through the network
    * The route can be traced after transmission though by **packet header reconstruction**, unless onion routing protocols/anonymisers like **Tor** are used

#### Requirements of a computer network

Essentially:

* Physical links between nodes are needed
* Mechanisms are needed to sharing shared communication media
* Other mechanisms are needed for forwarding messages by intermediaries
* Even more mechanisms are needed to ensure redundancy across the network; so that, if computers disconnect, then computers at one end of a network can reach others

Every node that participates in the network needs technologies to ensure that these requirements are satisfied, to ensure that network stability, security, speed and the ability to communicate are maintained.

What we hope to achieve therefore, is to allow **logical connections** amongst all nodes. Thus, every node can *technically* be connected to every other node, but not directly and not necessarily through physical means. 

* For example, **VPNs** can achieve a logical connection between two computers, or even two networks that may be geographically isolated from one another. A virtual, logical **tunnel** is created that passes through several routers and nodes between the two networks, but to the endpoints, they seem to be connected directly.
  * Encryption can also be layered on top of this tunnel to protect and obfuscate data from nodes that may be trying to eavesdrop on communications between the endpoints.
  * Using VPNs is a popular way to change your detected location, so for example if you are based in London but you connect to an endpoint in Amsterdam over *OpenVPN*, many internet services will detect that you are in Amsterdam and serve Netherlands-specific versions of their content rather than UK-specific content (such as Netflix, Google, etc).
    * This is used by many internet activists to circumvent state-sponsored censorship of digital content.
    * Many firewalls and routers can't actually detect that a VPN technology such as OpenVPN is being used if traffic is layered on top of a commonly used port that deals with encrypted data (like TLS - *TCP 443*), **unless the firewall/IDS is using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) methods**. 
      * The Chinese, Russian, Malaysian, Syrian and Egyptian governments have been known for using Deep Packet Inspection to censor content and drop Internet connections.

#### Logical System Architecture of Internet-connected systems

* A **network interface** is a combination of hardware and software components to implement the requirements of computer networks, discussed above.
  * The hardware part is called a **Network Interface Card (NIC)**, and may be connected to the computer over **USB**, or **PCI Express**.
* Computer-to-computer communication is handled over several layers
  * OSI Model, discussed above
  * Packet data is encapsulated for each layer, and then unwrapped in reverse on the receiving system
* Routers forward packets across networks, and **network interfaces**
  * Routers can also **masquerade** packets, using **network address translation (NAT)** to allow everyone on an internal network to share one external address, and the router forwards packets to each computer inside the internal network
    * Many internet service providers enforce NAT on their routers, as the **IPv4 address space** is very quickly **running out of unique addresses**. Transitioning to IPv6 helps this greatly.




### The Data-link layer

* There are many different ways to transmit data

  * Electrical, light, sound, radio/microwave

* But, transmission has potential for noise to creep in

  * How to solve this?

* If wires run parallel to each other, the current flowing through one of the wires can **induce** current in the other through **the principle of electromagnetic induction**

  * **Faraday's law**, EMF generated $$\epsilon = -N\frac{d\phi_B}{dt}$$ , A-level physics content
  * This causes **electrical interference (noise)**, and this disrupts our signal somewhat

* Twisting wires together can expose each wire equally to this induction of EMF

* *Better solution*: Shielding around twisted pairs (coaxial cable); shielding determines maximum data transfer rate

  | Category | Description                                              | Data Rate (Mbps)   |
  | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
  | CAT1     | Unshielded twisted pair (telephony)                      | < 0.1              |
  | CAT2     | Unshielded twisted pair (T1)                             | 2                  |
  | CAT3     | Improved CAT2 used for computer networks                 | 10                 |
  | CAT4     | Improved CAT3 used for Token Ring networks               | 20                 |
  | CAT5     | Unshielded twisted pair used for networks *(Ethernet)*   | 100                |
  | CAT5E    | Extended CAT5 for greater immunity to noise *(Ethernet)* | 1000 (1 Gigabit)   |
  | CAT6     | Shielded twisted pair *(Ethernet)*                       | 10000 (10 Gigabit) |

#### Transmission modes

* **Serial**: single wire carries one bit at a time
  * Cheaper
  * More reliable
  * USB, PCI Express (PCI-e), Serial ATA (SATA), SPI
  * Can be *asynchronous* (e.g. UART)
* **Parallel**: group of wires, each can carry one bit at a time *simultaneously*
  * Higher potential bandwidth due to simultaneous transmission
  * Interconnect bus between CPU-RAM
* Serial data transmission has a challenge: **which bit should be sent first?**
  * Both sender & receiver must agree on the order in which bytes are transmitted
  * **Big-endian** vs **little-endian**
  * Example: Ethernet uses **byte big-endian, bit little-endian** order
    * Least significant bit of the most significant byte is sent first

#### Simplex vs Duplex

* Simplex: One way communication **only**
* Half-duplex: Two-way communication, but **one-way at a time** *(walkie-talkie)*
* Full-duplex: Two-way **simultaneous** communication

Can **multiplex** and **demultiplex** data onto a shared bus to reduce the number of individual transmission channels

* This happens on telephone voice connections, and broadband connections between ISP and backbone/peer

#### Circuit switching vs Packet switching

* **Circuit switching**: Provide point-to-point connections between pairs of endpoints

  * Establish path between sender and receiver
  * Performance is equal to an isolated physical path

* **Packet switching**: Multiplex connections over shared media

  * After sending one packet, sender allows others the chance to transmit too
    * No need to wait until communication is finished unlike circuit switching

  * Aware of and supports asynchronicity

## Channelisation Protocols

Four main protocols:

* **Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA)**: 
  * Give users an allocation of one or more frequency bands
* **Time-division multiple access (TDMA)**: 
  * Allows users to share a frequency channel by dividing the signal into time slots
* **Code-division multiple access (CDMA)**
  * Allows users to share several frequency bands by using transmitter-assigned codes (kind of a multiplexing technique)
* **Space-division multiple access (SDMA)**
  * Create parallel spatial *pipes* to allow superior performance for many users close together
  * Related to *MU-MIMO* technology

##### TDMA: Who decides when pairs can communicate?

* TDMA is reliant on a **predefined pattern of time slots**
* Nodes must maintain an **asynchronous clock** to prevent nodes running over-bounds
* A **central authority** controls and allocates time slots
* Nodes transmit whenever they want to use the channel (known as *Random Access*)
  * This can increase the probability of frame collisions, discussed later

### 'Random Access' Protocols

* **ALOHA**: A historic protocol used in an early radio network in Hawaii; popular in textbooks and is easy to analyse, but **not really used anymore in real networks**
* **CSMA/CD** **Carrier Sense Multi-Access with Collision-Detection**: the basis for the original ***Ethernet*** protocol, still widely used
* **CSMA/CA Carrier Sense Multi-Access with Collision-Avoidance**: the basis for ***IEEE 802.11*** (Wi-Fi) wireless network connections

#### Pure ALOHA

The concept for **Pure ALOHA** is:

1. Each node **arbitrarily initiates transmissions** when it has data to send
2. When a node has no data for transmission, it **continuously listens to the channel**

Pure ALOHA has problems with data collisions though:

* Collisions happen **frequently** in Pure ALOHA; these result in unsuccessful transmission, and the sender **must retransmit the whole frame**
* If inbound frames collide, then each sender **waits a random time and retransmits**

The **throughput** of a MAC Layer can be summarised by

$$ S = \lim\limits_{T \to \infty}(\frac{\sum successful \space transmission\space periods\space in \space T}{T})$$

where $T$ is the time interval defined - as for a given $T$, some sub-interval $T_\alpha$ may be idle, another sub-interval $T_\beta$ may have a successful transmission and another sub-interval $T_\delta$ may have only collisions.

The throughput for **Pure ALOHA** can be defined as

$$S_{pure} = Ge^{-2G}$$

where $G$ is defined as the average number of frames requested per frame-time.

#### Slotted ALOHA

A modified version of ALOHA to attempt to reduce collision periods, that works by:

1. Nodes only initiating transmissions **at the beginning of a predefined time slot**
2. Strictly enforcing **MAC-layer synchronisation**

The idea is that the collision period for each network frame will be reduced to half of that in Pure ALOHA, hence:
$$ S_{slotted} = Ge^{-G}$$

A graph can be constructed that illustrates the difference between the two ALOHA protocols:

## LAN Technologies

### Ethernet

* *De facto* wired LAN standard
* Invented at Xerox PARC in 1973
  * Standardised by Xerox and Intel in 1978
* Frame has a 14-byte header, followed by a payload of 46 to 1500 bytes
* Header has 6 bytes for destination address, 6 bytes for source address and 2 byte *type*
* End of Ethernet frame has 4 byte **CRC** for Forward Error Correction

#### Address Filtering

* When frames are sent, they are sent to **all devices**
* Devices ignore frames that aren't meant for them (differing destination address)
* Station accepts a copy of a frame if the destination address matches, by:
  * Station's unicast address
  * Broadcast address
  * Multicast address to which the station is listening on
* Can place stations into **promiscuous mode** to receive all frames even if they aren't meant for them

#### Frame type field

* 2-byte field in frame header
* Identifies the content of the frame
* Usually handled by protocol software
* Values are standardised

Examples:

* `0x0800` for IPv4
* `0x86DD` for IPv6
* `0x0806` for ARP

#### Ethernet wiring type

* **Thicknet**: Heavy coaxial cable, usually in the ceiling/floor
* **Thinnet**: Flexible coaxial cable, where a user could potentially disconnect the network
* **Twisted pair**: Has a *RJ-45* connector on the end, modern cable

### Wireless networks

Must operate within ISM bands that are regulated by FCC/Ofcom/European Union

- 26 MHz region between **902-928MHz**
- 83.6MHz region between **2.4-2.484GHz**
- 125MHz region between **5.725-5.850GHz**
- These regions can be subdivided into **wireless channels**
  - 11 channels usually defined in the 2.4GHz region
  - 22MHz wide channels == interference!
  - Channels 1, 6 and 11 can operate simultaneously without interference

#### Personal area network (PAN)

* Spans a short distance
* Dedicated to a single user; not shared
* ***Bluetooth***
* ***Infrared***
* ***ZigBee***: Smart home mesh communication

#### Wireless LAN

* Utilises and complies to IEEE open standards
* **IEEE 802.11** 
  * 802.11b: up to 11Mbps
  * 802.11g: up to 54Mbps
  * 802.11n: up to 600Mbps
  * 802.11ac: up to 6.93Gbps (*theoretical, using eight 160MHz 256-QAM modulated channels*)
* IEEE defines two operation modes for wireless LAN communication
  * **Infrastructure**: many clients connect to one AP
  * **Ad-hoc**: direct communication between clients without an AP

##### 802.11 frame specifics

* An 802.11 frame is not the same as an Ethernet frame


* Each frame has four MAC addresses
  * Source
  * Destination
  * Router along the path to the Internet
  * Additional address for ad-hoc mode

##### CSMA/CA with 802.11 communication

* **Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance**
* Requires RTS and CTS messages
* Delay associated with messages to ensure protocol efficiency
  * **SIFS** (10 &micro;s): Short Inter-Frame Space
  * **DIFS** (50 &micro;s): Distributed Inter-Frame Space
  * Slot time: 20 &micro;s
