# Artificial Intelligence (COM2028)

## Image Processing

* Algorithmic processing of raw information from sensors and visual systems (cameras)
* Understand how sensory stimuli are created by the world in general

### Flow of processing

* Move from specifics to generics
* Captured data -> Pre-processing (enhancement) -> Feature Extraction -> Object classification (specific) -> Image classification (general)

### Image analysis techniques

* Template matching
* Pattern recognition with feature extraction
* Edge detection

### How to manipulate images?

* **Brightness enhancement**
  * Scale all values by a constant
  * $$g(x,y) = f(x,y) + k$$
* **Contrast enhancement**
  * Scale all values again by a constant
  * $$g(x,y) = af(x,y)$$
* **Average of two images**
* **Spatial resolution**
  * Measure of how closely lines can be resolved in an image
  * *clarity of image*
* **Amplitude resolution**
  * How many different shades of grey or colour
  * 16-bit, 8-bit, 4-bit colour images etc

### Objectives of image processing

* Enhance features that are useful
* Reduce noise
* Obtain **salient features** of image content (key representations)

## Image transforms

* Point transforms
* Local transforms
* Global transforms

### Point transforms

* Manipulating individual pixel values
  * Brightness/contrast enhancement
* Histogram manipulation
* Image magnification

### Mapping

* Linear
* Non-linear
  * **Logarithmic mapping**: enhance darker regions of image, at the expense of lighter region details
  * **Exponential mapping**: enhance lighter regions of image, at the expense of darker region details
* Can map ranges of pixels onto a new range:
  * $$\frac{g(x,y) - g_1}{f(x,y) - f_1} = \frac{g_2 - g_1}{f_2 - f_1}$$
  * $$g(x,y) = g_1 + (\frac{g_2-g_1}{f_2-f_1})(f(x,y) - f_1)$$

###Image histogram

* Measure frequency of the occurrence of each grey/colour value

  ```python
  pixels_x = []
  pixels_y = []
  histogram = []
  i = 0
  for all grey in pixels:
      histogram[i] = 0
      i += 1
  for (x,y) in enumerate(zip(pixels_x, pixels_y)):
      histogram[f(x,y)] += 1
  ```



* **Cumulative histogram**: Records **cumulative frequency distribution** of grey levels in an image

  * Is a mapping that counts the cumulative number of pixels in all of the bins up to a specified bin number
  * Defined by *cumulative histogram* $H_k = \sum_{j=0}^{k}h_j$

## Feature Extraction and Segmentation

A computer needs a training algorithm to be able to recognise objects in images

#### Gestalt Laws of Perception

* Gestalt Law of Similarity
* Gestalt Law of Continuation
* Gestalt Law of Closure

#### SIFT

Stands for **Scale Invariant Feature Transform**

* Converting an image into feature vectors that were invariant to scale, translation and rotation operations
* Can be used as a *descriptor* of an image

#### ImageNet

Database of categorised images

## Neural Networks

### Brains vs Artificial Neural Networks

* A brain can be considered a **highly complex**, **non-linear** and **parallel information-processing system**.
* Learning is a fundamental and essential characteristic of biological neural networks. The ease with which they can learn led to attempts to emulate a biological neural network using computers.
* In the brain, each neuron has a very simple structure. However, since there are many of them, collectively they consitute a tremendously powerful way to perform processing.
  * Each neuron consists of a cell body (**soma**), a number of fibres (**dendrites**) and a single long fibre (**axon**), covered in a **myelin sheath** to add electrical insulation.
  * A neuron only fires if its input signal exceeds a certain amount (an electrical voltage threshold) in a short time period.
  * The spikes travelling along the axon of the pre-synaptic neuron trigger the release of neurotransmitter chemicals at the synapse.
